## Instruction

This project is a supplemental page to the [RRD-603 paper](https://). This project includes the dataset of RRD-603 and the code corresponding to [MPRNET](https://), [DuRN](https://), and [AttentiveGAN](https://).

## Datasets

The RRD-603 dataset is now available for download on [Baidu Cloud](https://) and [Google Drive](https://).

## Models

We provide our pre-trained models, and of course you can find them on the original project's homepage.

## Train & Test

We follow the source code of various algorithms for training and testing, and it is worth noting that all test results are obtained under [Skimage.Metrics](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.metrics.html?highlight=ssim#skimage.metrics.peak_signal_noise_ratio).
